## About The Project

Not Much Else was a clarinet performance that I was able to perform in with my friend Connor Bohn. It was for his â€‹senior recital at Columbia College Chicago and he approached me as he wanted to do something more electronic for one of his pieces and he knew that I was into DSP programming. The patch is made up of three main parts that play into the A and B sections of the piece. There is a shimmer reverb, a spectral freeze, and a 4-tap delay.

This repository holds the Max patch that was made for the performance.
